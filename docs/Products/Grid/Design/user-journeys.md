# User Journeys

This is an example user journey broadly describing a use case for the Grid.

**User**: Katy (Nutritionist)

**User Wants/Needs**: Katy is a nutritionist and personal trainer who provides diet and exercise information to her clients. She creates charts in Excel with information tailored to each client based on their preferences.

She manually formats the cells to look like a flowchart and display the different diet and exercise options. She also adds extra cells with her own notes about the benefits/drawbacks
of each option. She does this to help the client make decisions about their options within the scope of their preferences.

Katy would like to avoid having to create each chart manually for each client. She would like to be able to automatically generate charts for her clients based on their preferences and not have to repeat herself for each chart.
