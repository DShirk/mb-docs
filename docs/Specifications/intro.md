Shirk Law provides deliverables to clients that answer their questions about the law. Typically, these deliverables take the form of documents that include tables of information, as well as relevant citations, graphs, images, etc as needed. The information delivered can be described as a collection of legal conclusions made by Shirk Law as well other information that supports those conclusions. Supporting information can be described as references (eg, it's source of authority), as well as identifying information (eg, the state in which the conclusion is valid).

### What are we building?

We aim to create a graph database system to represent our conclusions about the law with more detail and accuracy than currently possible. We also aim to create tools to greatly improve the experience of creating deliverables for Shirk Law clients that leverage this increased detail and accuracy.

### What problems are we trying to solve?

Currently, the relationships between legal conclusions and their supporting information must be identified and recorded manually by Shirk Law employees.

By storing our legal conclusions with better detail and accuracy, we aim to be able to automate the answers to questions like:

- "Have I answered this question about the law before?"
- "Where else have I cited this conclusion I made?"
- "What other conclusions reference this authority?"

### What components are needed to meet our goal?

- A tool for assembling tables with information from our database.
- A tool to build live documents that contain tables, text, diagrams, images, etc for delivery to clients.
- A tool to manage our database of conclusions and their relationships to supporting information.

### Scope

The scope described in this document should be limited only to the core features needed to create a minimum viable product. This MVP can be used to provide more immediate value while also gathering data and feedback that can be applied to improve future iterations.
