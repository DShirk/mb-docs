# What are we creating?

A system to store legal data points and the relationships between them.

## Why are we building this system?

Shirk Law provides deliverables to clients that answer questions about the law, specific to each clients needs. Typically these deliverables take the form of documents that can include information tables created in Excel, as well as relevant citations, graphs, images, etc as needed. The information presented can be described as a amalgamation of legal conclusions made by Shirk Law, as well as the relevant citations and references to authorities that back up those conclusions.

We aim to create a database system to hold these conclusions as well as the relationships they have to their supporting information (ie, their citations, authority, etc.) We also aim to create web-based tools to facilitate the creation of these deliverables by Shirk Law employees.

## What problems are we trying to solve?

Currently, the relationships between certain legal conclusions and their supporting information must be identified and recorded manually by Shirk Law employees.

We aim to automate the answers to questions like:
"Have I answered this question about the law before?"
"Where else have I cited this conclusion I made?"
"What other conclusions reference this authority?"

## What components do we need to achieve our goal?

- A tool for assembling tables with information from our database.
- A tool to build documents that contain deliverables such as tables, text, diagrams, images, etc to deliver to clients.
- A tool to enter, update, and delete conclusions and the relationships between conclusions in our database.
