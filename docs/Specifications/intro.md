# What are we creating?

A system to store legal data points and the relationships between them.

## Why are we building this system?

Shirk Law provides deliverables to clients that answer questions about the law, specific to each clients needs. Typically these deliverables take the form of documents that can include information tables created in Excel, as well as relevant citations, graphs, images, etc as needed. The information presented can be described as a amalgamation of legal conclusions made by Shirk Law, as well as the relevant citations and references to authorities that back up those conclusions.

We aim to create a database system to hold these conclusions as well as the relationships they have to their supporting information (ie, their citations, authority, etc.) We also aim to create web-based tools to facilitate the creation of these deliverables by Shirk Law employees.

## What problems are we trying to solve?

Currently, our corpus of legal data is fractured and disjointed? Meaning it is difficult to look at a particular conclusion we've drawn and understand it's useage elsewhere in our corpus.

"Where else have I cited this conclusion I made?"

## What components do we need to achieve our goal?

- A tool for assembling charts from these data points for presentation.
- A tool to build pages or documents that contain charts, paragraphs of text, diagrams, etc to deliver to clients.
- A tool to enter, update, and delete data and relationships in our database.

## Extras

- A web scraper to pull data from different authorities and enter it into our database.
- A parser to chunk text from PDF/other documents and enter it into our database.
- An AI assistant to perform grounded searches on our database.
