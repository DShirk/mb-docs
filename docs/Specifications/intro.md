# Intro

Shirk Law provides deliverables to clients that answer their questions about the law. Typically, these deliverables take the form of documents that include tables of information, as well as relevant citations, graphs, images, etc as needed to provide an adequate answer. The deliverables can be described as a collection of legal conclusions with supporting information. Supporting information can be described as references (eg, it's source of authority) as well as identifying information (eg, the jurisdiction in which the conclusion is valid).

### What is our goal?

We aim to create an enhanced system for storing and understanding the firm’s knowledge base. This system will allow for the capture and presentation of the law firm’s assumptions and conclusions about the law, with all sources for such conclusions cited to relied upon authorities.

By relating all stored materials to the legal authorities relied upon, the relationships of all uses and changes in understanding in the various circumstances will be visually represented and provide for rapid retrieval of prior work effort.

### What problems are we trying to solve?

Currently, the relationships between legal conclusions and their supporting information are manually recorded by Shirk Law in memorandums, letters, and charts. Each addresses large questions of applications to broad fact patterns or very specific circumstances but do not store discrete conclusions of law relied upon in those materials in a manner that allows for effective reuse.

In addition:

- The authority of the information stored in our corpus is constantly updating.

- Work on the corpus is difficult to assign to employees and review.

- Clients are not able to access our corpus of information without going through a firm representative.

### What is the scope of this specification?

The scope described in this current specification should be limited to the core features needed to create a minimum viable product. This MVP can be used to provide more immediate value while also gathering data and feedback that can be applied to improve future iterations.

### What Initiatives are needed for our MVP?

:::note

TODO: Evaluate scope of MVP to determine which initiatives are needed.

:::

- A graph database to store legal conclusions and their relationships to supporting information.
- The ability to view and manage our database of conclusions and their relationships.
- The ability to assemble tables with information from our database.
- The ability to build documents that contain tables, text, diagrams, images, etc for delivery to clients.
