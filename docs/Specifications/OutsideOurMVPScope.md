# Outside MVP Scope

This section is reserved for features we've discussed that we'll revisit for later iterations of this product.

- The larger design goal is for resale to other law firms, and with additional authority hierarchies and user interface adaptation, for non-attorney uses. 
- System should be capable of deployment in any legal practice.
- System should be extensible by any of the firms internally and externally sourced data repositories.
- Allow users to identify resources for ingestion, identify key elements in representative resources and train AI tools to ingest them with automatic updates to designated libraries (E.g. regulatory enforcement actions with identified extraction elements like: parties, asserted violations, penalties, number of affected victims, etc.). 
- The system will have capacity to document very deeply nested relationships but can also store and manage simple concepts like the preliminary hypothesis of an advising attorney or the desired outcome of a requesting client. In this way the system can be very sparsely or extremely densely populated with a visual representation as a node graph showing the degree of research supporting the conclusion and thus supporting the level of confidence.
