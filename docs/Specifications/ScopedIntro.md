## Intro

Questions:
Where is the state licensing information? I want to get my hands on the data, it will help immensely.

What:
To store state licensing information.
To understand the clients circumstances - who they are (business or person), where they are (California, etc),
To be able to identify the relevant scope of the law based on the clients circumstances.
To be able to tag elements of the law to classify them. Ie, one state law may have an element called jaywalking, another may have an element called improper use of roadway.
